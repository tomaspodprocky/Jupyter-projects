# About
A small repository to hold and keep track of my Jupyter notebooks.

- Microsoft Datascience 2019 capstone: a project from the Microsoft Professional program in Datascience in 2019 before it was stopped. This code/project is already several years old. I may do cleanup changes and small improvements (which I learned since then), but otherwise the plan is to keep the project intact. I will add/update documentation into the Jupyter notebooks.
